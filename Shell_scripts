1. Redirect file discriptor of the script file: temporary vs permanently redirection. temporary - regular commands, permanently - exec command.
> exec 2>log.err # Permanently redirect standard error discriptor to log.err in current shell
> grep "$test" ./* 2>/dev/null #redirects standard error discriptor temporarily to /dev/null
  
2. 'end of file' vs 'no data available right now': in the pipeline, 'end of file' happens to the after command when the front command terminated, otherwise 'no data available right now'.
> sh -c 'sleep 5' | ( date; cat; date)

where cat got 'end of file' after 5 seconds. The 'end of file' is the file discriptor closed, exec redirection also does it.

 (echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  echo "test again" 2>/dev/null) | (date;cat;date)
Wed Jan 14 07:37:12 CST 
test again #from stdin
Wed Jan 14 07:37:12 CST 

Where redirect >&2 did not affect following command's standard output file discriptor (temporary);

 (echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  exec >&2; echo "test again" 2>/dev/null) | (date;cat;date)
test again #from stdout of front command, as the stdout redirected not treated as stdin of following.

Where exec >&2 affected following command's standard output file discriptor (permanently).
 (echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  exec 3>&1; exec >/tmp/stdout; echo "test again"; exec >&3; echo "my test" ) | (date;cat;date) 2>/dev/null

3. how to tell shell commands from shell external utility binary commands - anything you may find in /bin. e.g. true is not shell command but : is. It is important for writing portable shell scripts.

4. Here Document:a) hyphen after << tells shell to strip leading tabs (but not leading spaces); b) if the sentinel is quoted, the input in Here Document like single quoted - no substitutions are performed on the text. 

5.tokenize - maximal munch: (Tokens - word, keyword, special charactors)
 echo a #b;echo c# d e
a
 echo a #b
a
 echo c# d e
c# d e

Cannot expand variables into special kokens - only plain words. the results of substitution, globbing, or quoting are always words.

 str="X=3"
 $str
-bash: X=3: command not found
 eval $str; echo $X
3
