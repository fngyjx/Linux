1. Redirect file discriptor of the script file: temporary vs permanently redirection. temporary - regular commands, permanently - exec command.
> exec 2>log.err # Permanently redirect standard error discriptor to log.err in current shell
> grep "$test" ./* 2>/dev/null #redirects standard error discriptor temporarily to /dev/null
  
2. 'end of file' vs 'no data available right now': in the pipeline, 'end of file' happens to the after command when the front command terminated, otherwise 'no data available right now'.
> sh -c 'sleep 5' | ( date; cat; date)

where cat got 'end of file' after 5 seconds. The 'end of file' is the file discriptor closed, exec redirection also does it.

 (echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  echo "test again" 2>/dev/null) | (date;cat;date)
Wed Jan 14 07:37:12 CST 
test again #from stdin
Wed Jan 14 07:37:12 CST 

Where redirect >&2 did not affect following command's standard output file discriptor (temporary);

 (exec 3>&1; exec >/tmp/stdout; echo "test again" ) | (date;cat;date) 2>/dev/null
Wed Jan 14 12:07:46 CST 2015
Wed Jan 14 12:07:46 CST 2015
Where exec >/tmp/stdout redirect stdout to the file (permanently in sub shell that command grouped with parentheses[()])
 {echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  exec 3>&1; exec >/tmp/stdout; echo "test again" } | (date;cat;date) 2>/dev/null
Where stdout redirection also used after the pipe because the redirection is in current shell by using braces [{}] grouping the commands. 
( exec 3>&2 2>&1 #to get you stdout back to screen)
 (echo "test" 2>/dev/null >&2 ;  exec 3>&1; exec >/tmp/stdout; echo "test again"; exec >&3; echo "my test" ) | (date;cat;date) 2>/dev/null
Wed Jan 14 07:59:58 CST 
my test

subshell usually more computationally expensive than compound statements. change () to {} when possible.

3. how to tell shell commands from shell external utility binary commands - 
    anything you may find in /bin. e.g. true is not shell command but : is.
    It is important for writing portable shell scripts.

4. Here Document: (cat <<limit_string)
    a) hyphen after << tells shell to strip leading tabs (but not leading spaces);
    b) if the sentinel is quoted, the input in Here Document like single quoted - no substitutions are performed on the text.
    e.g.
cat <<'Endofmessage'
    
Hello, there, $NAME.
Greetings to you, $NAME, from $RESPONDENT.

Endofmessage
similarly, double quote or escape the sentinel (Limit string) will turn off the variable expandsion also:
cat <<'Endofmessage';
cat <<\Endofmessage;

cat <<"SpecialCharTest"

Directory listing would follow
if limit string were not quoted.
`ls -l`

Arithmetic expansion would take place
if limit string were not quoted.
$((5 + 3))

A a single backslash would echo
if limit string were not quoted.
\\

SpecialCharTest


5.tokenize - maximal munch: (Tokens - word, keyword, special charactors)
 echo a #b;echo c# d e
a
 echo a #b
a
 echo c# d e
c# d e

Cannot expand variables into special kokens - only plain words. the results of substitution, globbing, or quoting are always words.

 str="X=3"
 $str
-bash: X=3: command not found
 eval $str; echo $X
3

keywords: ! { } case do done elif else esac fi for if in then while until

command lists - command list can be endded with a special keyword. the command list exist status is the last command existing status.
  while if true; then false; fi do false;done
  echo $?
 0
 where fi ends the command list of while.
  while true do false; break;done;
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `done'
where command list of while does not end. 
 while true; do false; break;done;
 echo $?
0
Where ';' ends the command list of while.

short circuits : if exit condition can be determined the cmd2 can be skipped.
cmd1 && cmd2 # both true is true otherwise false
cmd1 || cmd2 # either true is true, both false is false.
so that if cmd1 is false then cmd2 after && will be skipped; in the other side cmd2 after || will be executed.
        if cmd1 is true the cmd2 after && will not be skipped and cmd2 after || will be skipped

Use external shell to start a completely independent (to parent) background task.

sh -c "back_ground_task >/dev/null 2>&1 </dev/null &"

The standard I/O redirection is important, cus the parent process may have I/O stream opened when the back ground process is started to preent they are closed when the back ground task exits.

sh -c "tar cf - $dir | bizp2 | ssh user@remote \"bzip2 -dc | tar xf -\" &"

tar cf - . | (cd $target_dir; tar xpf -)

tar unlike cp command, it preserves a broad varity of nonstatandard files, such as device nodes.

md5sum Shell_scripts

command substitute:
var=`md5sum Shell_scripts`; echo "var=["$var"]"
 var=[80dcfb33778ff19dae3a8777e4722c5e Shell_scripts]

Pipe redirection

md5sum Shell_scripts | read var; echo "var=["$var"]"

md5sum Shell_scripts | ( read var; echo "var=["$var"]"

#!/bin/sh  #ELF - executable and linking format (#! called as shebang- short for sharp-bang)

Shell Inter-process commuications: pipe, exit status, signal (kill-trap, kill 0 pid not signaling but check if the process of pid exists.

Background process.
delay=5;sh -c 'sh -c "sleep $delay; kill $$" >/dev/null 2>&1 & exec sh -c \'$*\' ''
 sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
 sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
Above, escape single quote was not working

Following, single-quotes have single-quotes in double-quotes was working.
delay=5;sh -c 'sh -c "sleep '$delay'; kill $$" >/dev/null 2>&1 & exec sh -c "'"$*"'" '

back-ground process id is stored in $!

An elegant timeout function by Alan Barett:

func_timeout() ( #note not use {
  timeout=$1
  shift
  "$@" &
  childpid=$!
  (
    trap 'kill -TERM $sleeppid 2>/dev/null; exit 0' TERM
    sleep $timeout &
    sleeppid=$!
    kill -TERM $childpid 2>/dev/null
    sleep 2
    kill -KILL $childpid 2>/dev/null
  ) &
  alarmpid=$!
  wait $childpid 2>/dev/null
  status=$?
  kill -TERM $alarmpid 2>/dev/null

  return $status
)


Shell Operations in order
1st. Tokenizing #creates tokens.  This is the only phase that can create keywords or special shell punctuation. Words are split on whitespace.
2nd. Brace Expansion  #only in some shells
3rd. Tidle expansion
4th. Substitution #variable and command substitution
5th. Field splitting #results of substitution split on $IFS
6th. Globbing
7th. Rediredtion
8th. Execution.

exceptions: 
1. The control expression of a 'case' statement and right-hand-side of variable assignment, the field splitting and globbing are not performed.
2.  Quotings: from 3rd to 6th operations, in single-quotes none performed; in double-quotes only substitutions are performed.

The steps take one command at a time unless the commands are in the same line separated by ';'.

the assignment: a=one two will be failed if there is no command two available - the assignment followed command two. Also the current shell's a variable will not be affected. 

a="one two"
b=$a #OK - no field splitting in assignment. Tokenizing (word spliting) found $a is syntax OK.
echo $b
 one two


Convert utf file to ascii file - use iconv

iconv -f utf-8|16 -t iso-8859-1 utf-file > ascii-file
